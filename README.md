# FaceDetectionApp
An application that recognizes the user's face by the front camera of a cell phone.
The detection happens in several stages:
Step 1- Place the cell phone at an angle of 70-110 degrees for 3 seconds
Step 2- Look with the face at the front camera of the action.
If we moved the operation from the correct angle (see angle within 1), return to step 1.

Uses the library Mlkit for face detection.
